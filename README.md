# Email-Phishing-Simulation
The project was done using Kali Linux OS in a virtual environment VMware machine.
'Sendemail' is the tool which was used to send an authentic looking email with some other username using our own email as base email.
Brevo was used to provide with SMTP server and a port number.
The email was sent with a link which can tend the receiver to open a fake website and cause some kind of damage.
